# Connect4
This project was done by my classmate Guillermo and me for an University sbuject in my 4th year of Software Engineering. It is the commonly known game Connect 4, made for Android.

The project is divided in several modules: 

1. The model of the game. This is where all the logic of the games takes place: the moveset, the tokens class, etc. This was programmed in Kotlin and Java.

2. The user interface. This was done with the Android Studio IDE and programmed in Kotlin and Java. There are several fragments (this is what the different screens are called in Android) for both horizontal and vertical views.

3. The database. The game has an online component where you are able to create games and people in the same area can join your game. We used the free Firebase database of Google.
